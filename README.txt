Applied Machine Learning


The dataset is centered around Alzheimer's disease patients and encompasses a range of features related to their demographic, cognitive, and neuroimaging characteristics. Here's a brief description of each feature:

Group: This categorical variable likely represents different classes or groups within the dataset, possibly indicating the disease status of the patients (e.g., "Nondemented," "Demented," "Converted").

Age: This numerical feature represents the age of the patients, indicating their age at the time of data collection.

EDUC: The "Years of Education" feature reflects the number of years of formal education completed by the patients.

SES: This numerical variable likely represents the socioeconomic status of the patients on a scale from 1 to 5.

MMSE: The "Mini Mental State Examination" is a widely used cognitive assessment tool. This numerical feature likely captures cognitive performance.

CDR: The "Clinical Dementia Rating" is another measure of cognitive and functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease patients.

eTIV: "Estimated total intracranial volume" is a neuroimaging metric that estimates the total volume of the brain within the cranial cavity.

nWBV: "Normalized Whole Brain Volume" likely represents the volume of the brain normalized to a reference value, helping account for differences in head size.

ASF: "Atlas Scaling Factor" may be a scaling factor applied to brain imaging data to standardize measurements.

This dataset appears to be a valuable resource for studying Alzheimer's disease and understanding the relationship between various patient characteristics and cognitive outcomes. Further analysis and modeling can provide insights into the factors associated with the disease and its progression.
